Finding "Stars" using Max Spanning Trees and a UnionFind Data 
Structure

Idea:  Implement the UnionFind data structure and use it with a Max Spanning Tree 
algorithm for locate "stars" in a bit map.   The use the tree you constructed to design
"constellations."
Details:  A bit map image of the night sky would include some very bright spots and 
some very dark areas.   The bright spots are the stars and their "brightness" fades 
into the surrounding darkness.   You should construct some bitmaps the represent 
"night skys" and use the spanning tree algorithm to separate your sky into 
individual stars.   Then, figure out a way to use your tree to form constellations.
